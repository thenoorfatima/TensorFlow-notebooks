For your exercise see if you can improve MNIST to 99.8% accuracy or more using only a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D. You should stop training once the accuracy goes above this amount. It should happen in less than 20 epochs, so it's ok to hard code the number of epochs for training, but your training must end once it hits the above metric. If it doesn't, then you'll need to redesign your layers.\n","\n","I've started the code for you -- you need to finish it!\n","\n","When 99.8% accuracy has been hit, you should print out the string \"Reached 99.8% accuracy so cancelling training!\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sfQRyaJWAIdg","colab_type":"code","outputId":"25b2ab68-f651-4636-c636-cf476b112900","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1577691744705,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":83062,"user":{"displayName":"Noor Fatima","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mApQYMABtajgCZCy7cF1as2H2UpI9g5drQw9DFD=s64","userId":"06775967229168824100"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":553}},"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","\n","class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):\n","  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):\n","    if(logs.get('acc')>0.998):\n","      print(\"\\nReached 60% accuracy so cancelling training!\")\n","      self.model.stop_training = True\n","\n","callbacks = myCallback()\n","\n","\n","mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist\n","(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\n","\n","training_images=training_images.reshape(60000, 28, 28, 1)\n","training_images=training_images / 255.0\n","test_images = test_images.reshape(10000, 28, 28, 1)\n","test_images=test_images/255.0\n","\n","model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n","  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n","  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),\n","  #tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),\n","  #tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n","])\n","\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=10)\n","test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)\n","print(test_acc)\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<p style=\"color: red;\">\n","The default version of TensorFlow in Colab will soon switch to TensorFlow 2.x.<br>\n","We recommend you <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate\" target=\"_blank\">upgrade</a> now \n","or ensure your notebook will continue to use TensorFlow 1.x via the <code>%tensorflow_version 1.x</code> magic:\n","<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/tensorflow_version.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">more info</a>.</p>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Downloading data from https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz\n","11493376/11490434 [==============================] - 0s 0us/step\n","WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/resource_variable_ops.py:1630: calling BaseResourceVariable.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.resource_variable_ops) with constraint is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","Instructions for updating:\n","If using Keras pass *_constraint arguments to layers.\n","Train on 60000 samples\n","Epoch 1/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 13s 211us/sample - loss: 0.1381 - acc: 0.9587\n","Epoch 2/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 7s 109us/sample - loss: 0.0473 - acc: 0.9854\n","Epoch 3/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 7s 109us/sample - loss: 0.0297 - acc: 0.9906\n","Epoch 4/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 7s 109us/sample - loss: 0.0180 - acc: 0.9942\n","Epoch 5/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 6s 108us/sample - loss: 0.0126 - acc: 0.9958\n","Epoch 6/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 7s 110us/sample - loss: 0.0093 - acc: 0.9968\n","Epoch 7/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 6s 107us/sample - loss: 0.0072 - acc: 0.9974\n","Epoch 8/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 6s 108us/sample - loss: 0.0063 - acc: 0.9979\n","Epoch 9/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 7s 109us/sample - loss: 0.0046 - acc: 0.9984\n","Epoch 10/10\n","60000/60000 [==============================] - 7s 109us/sample - loss: 0.0043 - acc: 0.9984\n","10000/10000 [==============================] - 1s 59us/sample - loss: 0.0593 - acc: 0.9879\n","0.9879\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
